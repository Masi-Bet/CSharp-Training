# Overview
Aside from empowering you to take responsibility for your learning, this guide has been designed to strengthen your understanding of interfaces in C#.
You’ll be exploring how interfaces are declared, implemented, and extended by following Microsoft’s official tutorial on Interface Implementation. 
You can find the link to the tutorial at the end of the document. 

# Learning Objectives
By Completing this exercise, you will be able to: 
- Distinguish between implicit vs explicit interface implementation 
- Experiment with interface inheritance and default members. 
- Recognize how interfaces improve flexibility, modularity and testability in C# systems. 

# How to approach this Tutorial 

Being tossed into the deep end is often a good way to get to learn, however here’s five tips on how to make the most of the time that you’re going to dedicate to this. 

### 1. Read to understand, Don’t Skim 
Treat this tutorial as a form of guided exploration. As you read, ask yourself: “What problem does this solve?” and “Could I re-write this in my own words?”. 
Re-type all the examples and code snippets to assist in reinforcing syntax and structure. 

### 2. Experiment with Each Concept. 
After each code snippet, run it in your IDE. Modify it deliberately – remove access modifiers, add in additional interfaces, rename methods, really go out of your way to get your hands dirty here. 
Observe how the compiler responds and displays the errors (if any). This is how you start to internalize the rules. 

### 3. Focus on two Core takeaways
- The difference between implicit and explicit interface implementation. 
- How interfaces can inherit from other interfaces. 

### 4. Connect Back to out lessons Content
Relate what you learn back to the INotifiable and AlertService examples from our lesson. 
Ask: “Could we define explicit implementations here?”, “What happens if I change the interface contract?” 

### 5. Time Management
Expect to spend about 1 - 1.5 hours in total: 30 - 40 minutes reading and 30 minutes experimenting, depending on whether you read faster than your type or vice-versa. 
Learning by doing beats learning by simply reading. 

# Optional Challenge 

- Create your own mini example using interfaces not covered in the lesson. For example, design an ILogger interface with multiple implementations like FileLogger, ConsoleLogger, and DatabaseLogger. Try involving an explicit interface method to one of them.
